# Data Cleaning Internship Task

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my solution for a data cleaning internship task. The objective was to clean, standardize, and prepare a Kaggle dataset for further analysis using Excel.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Format: CSV
- The raw dataset was explored, cleaned, and preserved separately to maintain data integrity.

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning Steps Performed
1. Verified column headers and delimiter separation.
2. Froze header rows and applied filters for efficient exploration.
3. Identified missing values and handled them based on column context.
4. Removed duplicate records after creating a raw data backup.
5. Standardized text fields using TRIM and PROPER functions.
6. Corrected date, numeric, and categorical formats.
7. Created a separate Cleaned_Data sheet for final output.
8. Added a Data_Quality_Notes column to document data issues and decisions.
9. Saved the cleaned dataset in both Excel and CSV formats.

## 📁 Files Included
- `Cleaned_dataset.xlsx` – Final cleaned dataset with multiple sheets.
- `cleaned_dataset.csv` – CSV version for further analysis.
- `dataset/` – Original raw dataset.

## ✅ Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel

## ✨ Outcome
The dataset is now clean, standardized, and ready for analysis in tools such as Power BI, SQL, or Python.
